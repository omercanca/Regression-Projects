# Statistical Modeling II
This respository contains my final project from Stat 400 at Penn State. The class was taught by Dr. Scott Roths in the Spring of 2022.

## Final Project
The class consisted of weekly exercises on topics that include likelihood-based inference, generalized linear models, random and mixed effects modeling, multilevel modeling, etc. My goal for the final project was to use generalized linear models to predict the most popular halloween candy, and linear multilevel generalized linear models to predict tree heights
