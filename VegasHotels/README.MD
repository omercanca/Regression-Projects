# Stat 380
## Data Science Through Statistical Reasoning and Computation

This respository contains my final project from Stat 380 at Penn State. The class was taught by Dr. Jacopo Di Iorio in the Spring of 2022. 

### Final Project
This project was completed in conjunction with 3 other teammates. Our goal was to discover what factors were most influential in predicting a Las Vegas Hotelâ€™s online rating. We use techniques such as Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Dimensionality Reductions through PCA, Clustering, Stepwise Selection, and ANOVA.
